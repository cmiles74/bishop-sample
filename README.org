This project provides a sample application that uses the [[https://github.com/tnr-global/bishop][Bishop
library]]. Bishop makes it much easier to provide an API for your
web-service that understands the HTTP semantics. This sample
application provides a simple web-service that lets you manage a to-do
list.

* Building the Application

  You can check-out the project and the build it.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone git://github.com/tnr-global/bishop-sample.git
  cd bishop-sample
  export LEIN_SNAPSHOTS_IN_RELEASE=true
  lein uberjar
  ...watch Leiningen build...
  java -jar bishop-sample-1.0-standalone.jar
  #+END_SRC

* Sample Transactions

  Once you have the application built and running, it will respond to
  the standard created, update and delete requests. Examples of these
  requests are detailed below.

** Listing All To-Do Items

   #+END_SRC

** Updating a To-Do Item

   Note that you need a dash (“-”) before the “XPOST”. I couldn’t get
   it to look right in this README with the GitHub parser.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   $ curl -v http://localhost:3000/todos/1 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     XPUT -d '{
      "title" : "More creative writing",
       "description" : "Write more blog posts"}'
